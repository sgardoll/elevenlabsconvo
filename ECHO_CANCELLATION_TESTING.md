## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Debug Commands

```bash

adb logcat | grep -i "aec\|acousticecho"

# iOS audio session logs
# Use Xcode console and filter for "AVAudioSession"

# Flutter debug logs
flutter logs | grep -E "ðŸŽ¤|ðŸ”‡|ðŸ”Š"
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **AEC Not Available**

   - Verify device supports hardware AEC
   - Check audio permissions
   - Ensure correct audio source configuration

2. **Feedback Still Present**

   - Increase VAD threshold
   - Adjust soft ducking level
   - Check for hardware-specific audio routing issues

3. **Mode Changes Too Slow**
   - Verify stream subscription setup
   - Check for blocking operations in listener
   - Monitor for background audio interference

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Requirements

- âœ… No agent self-hearing in normal conditions
- âœ… Mode changes complete in < 20ms
- âœ… Soft ducking reduces feedback by 12 dB minimum
- âœ… VAD filters dead air below -50 dB

### Optimal Performance

- âœ… Mode changes complete in < 5ms
- âœ… Zero false positives in feedback detection
- âœ… Seamless audio quality during all operations
- âœ… Reliable performance across all supported devices
